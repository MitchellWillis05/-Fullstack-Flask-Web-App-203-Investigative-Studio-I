# 203-Investigative-Studio-I

As part of my second year studying Software Engineering at Yoobee Colleges, I developed this full-stack web application that integrates Flask, JavaScript/HTML, and a SQL database to create a modular, secure, and AI-enhanced platform.

**Overview**
This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build scalable, secure backend services using Flask

- Develop responsive, user-friendly frontend interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Implement data storage using SQL databases

- Integrate AI through the OpenAI API

- Design modular systems and manage multiple codebases efficiently

**Key Features**
-Secure User Authentication:
    Uses SHA-based encryption for handling user credentials securely.

-AI Integration:
     Dynamic, real time responses using the OpenAI API.

-Modular Architecture:
    Backend logic, data processing, and testing are separated into independent, well-organized scripts.

-SQL Database Support:
    Stores user data and session information with reliability and scalability.

-Email Automation:
    Includes functionality for sending automated emails for password recovery and email confirmation.

-Spam handling:
    User cooldowns for requests such as openAI requests and email sending have cooldowns managed through JavaScript and through Flask cookies.

**Tech Stack**
Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: SQLite - PostgreSQL

AI Integration: OpenAI API

Security: SHA encryption
