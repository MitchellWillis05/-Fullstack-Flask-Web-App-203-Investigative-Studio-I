                Pisces, the twelfth zodiac sign, is symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions, reflecting their dual nature. 
                Governed by Neptune, Pisces are known for their deep compassion, empathy, and artistic sensibilities. 
                They are intuitive, imaginative, and naturally empathetic, often drawn to creative pursuits. 
                Adaptable and easygoing, Pisces can sometimes be indecisive and easily influenced.
                
                In relationships, Pisces are loving, devoted, and highly romantic, seeking deep emotional connections. 
                As friends and family members, they are supportive and nurturing, creating warm and caring environments. 
                While they can be overly sensitive and prone to escapism, their compassion and creativity make them unique and cherished individuals.
